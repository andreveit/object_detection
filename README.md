# OBJECT DETECTION

## Project developed through the Tensor Flow Object Detection API tutorial.

The main idea behind it was to build a model to detect wheatear a person is wearing the PPE (personal protective equipment).
In this case, the model was trained to recognize a motorcycle helmet.

The pre-trained model chosen was the ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8, from the [Tensor Flow 2 Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md).

Due to the size and number of files was not possible to upload the local repository to GitHub.

However, it is possible to check out the results through this [LINK](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6757259782383558656/).
